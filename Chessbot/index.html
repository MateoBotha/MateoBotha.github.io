            <h1>This window is for downloading the latest Code for the <span class="programName">Chess Engine</span>.</h1>
            <h2>You can now use this site to easily download all of <a href="https://www.github.com/MateoBotha" class="noUnderline" class="linkToAccount">@MateoBotha</a>'s Github code</h2>
            <p>
                The download and installation process has been made many times easier thanks to this website! However, if you do want to
                download it without using this website, then I'd recommend you doing so! After all this website is made to make it easier 
                and it isn't a necessity. So, you can head on over to my <a href="https://www.github.com/MateoBotha/Java-Chessbot" class="noUnderline" class="linkToRepo">Github repository</a>
                and do the download and installation there.
